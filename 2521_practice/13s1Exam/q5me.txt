Operation             State of Queue after operation

initially             --
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'X')   X
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'A')   A X
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'J')   A J X
PQueueLeave(PQ)       J X
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'K')   J K X
PQueueLeave(PQ)       K X
PQueueLeave(PQ)       X

Implement PQ by using an integer time variable.
For a queue, the item with the lowest time value (oldest) should have the highest priority.
For a stack, the item with the highest time value (most recent) should have the highest priority.
