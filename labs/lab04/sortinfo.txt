- Mergesort 
- BubbleSort/SelectionSort should be slowest (n^2) for ascending (sorted) series.
- QuickSort/ShellSort1/ShellSort2 should be quickest (nlog(n)) for ascending (sorted) series, but slowest
  for descending (not sorted) series.
- Unmodified bubble sort is the only unstable sort.
- Randomised Quick Sort can help avoid worst case scenarios such as a perfectly sorted
array (compared to Vanilla and Median of Three).
- Shellsort Powers should be quicker than Shellsort Sedgewick on smaller datasets
    
- In best case (already sorted), (2) should be quicker than (1)
    
Pseudo-Bogo Sort - should be completely random in times on the same set of data.

Bubble Sort/Selection Sort VERY SIMILAR (1)
-------------------------------------------
Bubble sort - almost always slower than selection sort.
			- should be slowest (n^2) for ascending (sorted) series.
			- is an unstable sort.
			
Selection sort - almost always quicker than selection sort.
			   - should be slowest (n^2) for ascending (sorted) series.
			   - is a stable sort.
				
Modified Bubble Sort/Insertion Sort VERY SIMILAR (2)
----------------------------------------------------
Modified bubble sort - almost always slower than insertion sort.

Selection sort - almost always quicker than modified bubble sort.
  
Merge sort - should be quickest (nlog(n)) for all series  
  
Vanilla Quick Sort
    normal quick sort (pivot is the last element)
    
Quick Sort Median of Three
    pivot is the median of first last and middle elements
    
Randomised Quick Sort
    list is shuffled then vanilla quick-sorted
    
Shell Sort Powers of Two Four
    shell sort with intervals ..., 4096, 1024, 256, 64, 16, 4, 1
    
Shell Sort Sedgewick (Sedgewick-like)
    shell sort with intervals ..., 4193, 1073, 281, 23, 8, 1
